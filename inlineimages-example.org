Here are some examples that illustrate aspects of 
org-mode inlineimage that do not work right.

These point to possible bugs in org-mode proper.

The image that we are using in this example is
/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts/images/texture.jpg

If you are missing that file just do the equivalent of 
sudo apt install gimp

According To:

https://github.com/fniessen/refcard-org-mode/blob/master/README.org

/Image links/

To get image links, put a link to a file in the description.

Clicking on the image

#+begin_example
 [[http://orgmode.org/][file:/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts/images/texture.jpg]]
#+end_example

 Should lead to the Org mode home page.

In our environment in org-version = 9.1.9 emacs 27.0.5 and emacs 26.2.

with:

[[http://orgmode.org/][file:/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts/images/texture.jpg]]


We don't see the image. We just see the text of link description 
as a link.

=Image as [ [ file: imagePath ] ]=

#+begin_example
 [[file:/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts/images/texture.jpg]]
#+end_example

[[file:/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts/images/texture.jpg]]

We do see the image. And clicking on it just produces the image again.

You can enable inline-images with:

(org-display-inline-images)

and disbale them with 

(org-remove-inline-images)
or
(org-toggle-inline-images)

#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: inlineimages
